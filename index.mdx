# Welcome to Shield

Shield is a decentralized application for sharing confidential files and messages with unparalleled security and privacy. Leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized storage, Shield ensures that your private data is only ever seen by the intended recipient.

## What Makes Shield Different?

Unlike traditional platforms that rely on a central server, Shield is **trustless**. Access rules are enforced by an on-chain smart contract on Base Mainnet, meaning not even the Shield platform itself can access or censor your data.
