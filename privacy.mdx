## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2025

### Introduction

Shield is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our blockchain-based verification system.

### Information We Collect

#### Information You Provide

- **Verification Policy Details**: Information you enter when creating verification links, including expiration times and attempt limits
- **Contact Information**: Email address if you contact our support team
- **Usage Data**: How you interact with Shield, including features used and actions taken

#### Automatically Collected Information

- **Blockchain Data**: Verification attempts and policy information are recorded on the Base blockchain as part of the service's core functionality
- **Technical Information**: Browser type, device information, and IP addresses for security and service improvement
- **IPFS Storage**: Verification policies are stored on IPFS for decentralized access

### How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide and maintain the Shield verification service
- Process and record verification attempts on the blockchain
- Improve and optimize our services
- Respond to support requests and communications
- Detect and prevent fraud or abuse
- Ensure the security and integrity of our platform

### Blockchain and Transparency

#### Public Blockchain Records

Shield operates on the Base blockchain, which means:

- Verification attempts are recorded as permanent, public blockchain transactions
- Anyone can view verification records using blockchain explorers
- Blockchain data cannot be deleted or modified once recorded
- This transparency is a core feature of Shield's security model

#### What's Stored On-Chain

- Verification policy hashes
- Verification attempt timestamps
- Success/failure status of verification attempts
- Wallet addresses involved in transactions

### Data Storage and Security

#### Decentralized Storage

- **IPFS**: Verification policies are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized, permanent storage
- **Blockchain**: Verification records are stored on the Base network
- **Application Data**: Minimal application data is stored on secure servers

#### Security Measures

We implement industry-standard security measures including:

- Encryption of data in transit using HTTPS/TLS
- Secure smart contract development practices
- Regular security audits and updates
- Access controls and monitoring systems

### Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell or rent your personal information. Data may be shared with:

- **Blockchain Networks**: Verification data is published to the Base blockchain by design
- **IPFS Network**: Policy data is stored on IPFS for decentralized access
- **Service Providers**: Third-party services that help us operate Shield (hosting, analytics)
- **Legal Requirements**: When required by law or to protect our rights

### Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to:

- Access the verification data you've created
- Request information about how we process your data
- Contact us with privacy concerns or questions
- Stop using Shield at any time

**Important Note**: Due to the nature of blockchain technology, data recorded on the blockchain cannot be deleted or modified. This is an inherent characteristic of decentralized systems.

### Cookies and Tracking

Shield uses minimal cookies and tracking technologies:

- **Essential Cookies**: Required for basic functionality
- **Analytics**: To understand how users interact with Shield (anonymous)
- **Session Data**: To maintain your session while using the application

You can control cookies through your browser settings.

### Children's Privacy

Shield is not intended for users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe we have collected information from a child, please contact us immediately.

### International Data Transfers

Shield operates globally and uses blockchain technology that is inherently distributed across international borders. By using Shield, you acknowledge that your data may be processed in various countries.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of Shield after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

### Data Retention

- **Blockchain Data**: Permanent and immutable once recorded
- **IPFS Data**: Stored permanently on the distributed IPFS network
- **Application Data**: Retained as long as necessary for service operation
- **Support Communications**: Retained for a reasonable period to address your requests

### Compliance

Shield strives to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations. However, users should be aware that blockchain technology operates differently from traditional databases and some privacy rights (such as the right to deletion) cannot be fully implemented due to the immutable nature of blockchain records.
